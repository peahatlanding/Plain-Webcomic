# Webcomic Jekyll Theme
A simple webcomic theme for Jekyll, a static site generator. Built using Bootstrap.

This theme is meant to offer a free and relatively easy webcomic hosting solution for artists with little or no coding experience. [Here's the user guide for this theme](https://peahatlanding.github.io/Plain-Webcomic/docs/index.html). 


# Using This Theme

## STEP ONE: Install Jekyll
To use this theme, you'll need to install Jekyll. The easiest way to install Jekyll is to using RubyGems.

# STEP TWO: Download the Webcomic Code

1. Download this directory.
2. Use Terminal to navigate to where you’ve saved the directory. Type `jekyll serve` into Terminal.
3. If everything’s in the right place, Jekyll will serve the webcomic site to your local server! Paste `http://127.0.0.1:4000` into a browser to see it!
